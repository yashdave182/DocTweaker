# Branding Update Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Navigation Component** (`src/components/Navigation.tsx`):
   - Replaced the Zap icon with the favicon image in the header logo
   - Updated the import statement to remove unused Zap import
   - Maintained the same styling and layout

2. **Updated Footer Component** (`src/components/Footer.tsx`):
   - Replaced the Zap icon with the favicon image in the footer logo
   - Updated the import statement to remove unused Zap import
   - Maintained the same styling and layout

## Files Modified

- `src/components/Navigation.tsx`
- `src/components/Footer.tsx`

## Technical Details

The favicon image is referenced using the path `/favicon.ico` which matches the favicon file in the public directory. The image is displayed with the following properties:
- Width: 5px
- Height: 5px
- Object fit: contain (to preserve aspect ratio)

The gradient background (`gradient-hero`) is preserved to maintain visual consistency with the rest of the application.

## Verification

To verify the changes:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the home page
3. Check that the logo in the header uses the favicon image
4. Scroll to the footer and check that the logo there also uses the favicon image

## Expected Result

Both the header and footer logos now display the same favicon image that is used for the browser tab icon, providing consistent branding throughout the application.
