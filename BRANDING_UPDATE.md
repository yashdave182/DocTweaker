## Files Modified

- `src/components/Navigation.tsx`
- `src/components/Footer.tsx`

## Technical Details

The favicon image is referenced using the path `/favicon.ico` which matches the favicon file in the public directory. The image is displayed with the following properties:
- Width: 12px (increased from 10px)
- Height: 12px (increased from 10px)
- Object fit: contain (to preserve aspect ratio)

The gradient background (`gradient-hero`) has been removed from both logo containers to display the favicon image without any background. The container size was also increased from 14x14 to 16x16 pixels to accommodate the larger logo. The parent container height was increased from h-16 to h-20 to prevent size constraints.

## Favicon for Browser Tab

The favicon that appears in the browser tab (web URL) uses the standard size of 16x16 or 32x32 pixels. The favicon.ico file in the public directory is already appropriately sized for browser tabs. Increasing the file size beyond this won't make it appear larger in the browser tab as browsers have fixed sizes for tab icons.

## Verification

To verify the changes:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the home page
3. Check that the logo in the header is now larger (12x12 pixels instead of 10x10)
4. Scroll to the footer and check that the logo there is also larger (12x12 pixels instead of 10x10)
5. Verify that the logos are not constrained by the parent container

## Expected Result

Both the header and footer logos now display the same favicon image without any background at an increased size, providing consistent branding throughout the application that matches the browser tab icon. The logos are now even more prominent and visible, and the parent container height has been adjusted to prevent size constraints.
