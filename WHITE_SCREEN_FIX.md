# White Screen Issue Fix Summary

## Issue
Vercel deployment was showing a white screen instead of the application.

## Root Causes Identified and Fixed

### 1. Vercel Configuration
- Updated vercel.json to use "rewrites" instead of "routes" for proper SPA routing
- Ensured all frontend requests are redirected to index.html

### 2. Branding Inconsistencies
- Fixed remaining "DocTweak" references throughout the application
- Updated navigation, footer, and all page content to use "Verolabz"
- Updated testimonials and community content

### 3. Routing Issues
- Fixed broken links in navigation and footer
- Updated routes to point to existing pages
- Removed references to non-existent "/business" and "/students" routes

### 4. Component Updates
- Updated Navigation component to use "Document Enhancer" instead of "Doc Tweaker"
- Fixed Footer component links to point to existing routes
- Updated all page titles and content to use consistent branding
