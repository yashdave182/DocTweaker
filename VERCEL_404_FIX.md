# 404 Error Fix Summary

## Issue
Vercel deployment was returning 404 errors for the root path "/" and frontend was failing to load resources with "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()".

## Root Causes Identified and Fixed

### 1. Vercel Routing Configuration
- Updated vercel.json to ensure proper SPA routing
- Verified rewrites configuration to route all requests to index.html
- Removed unnecessary headers configuration that might interfere with routing

### 2. Vite Base Path Configuration
- Updated vite.config.ts to explicitly set base path to "/"
- Removed conditional base path configuration that might cause issues in production

### 3. Application Build Process
- Verified that the build process completes successfully
- Confirmed that all required files are generated in the dist directory
- Verified that asset paths in index.html are correct

## Files Modified

1. vercel.json - Updated routing configuration
2. vite.config.ts - Fixed base path configuration

## Verification Steps

1. Local build test passed successfully
2. Required files exist in dist directory:
   - dist/index.html
   - dist/assets/ (with JavaScript and CSS files)
   - dist/favicon.ico
3. Asset paths in index.html are correct
4. Vercel configuration is properly set up for SPA routing

## Next Steps

Deploy to Vercel again. The 404 error should now be resolved, and the application should load correctly.
