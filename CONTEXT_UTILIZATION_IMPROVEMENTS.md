# Context Utilization Improvements

## Issue Identified

The user's specific context (e.g., "add conclusion at the end") was not being properly emphasized in the enhancement process, leading to results that didn't address the user's primary request.

## Root Cause

While the context was being passed to Gemini, it wasn't being properly emphasized as the PRIMARY focus of the enhancement. The prompt structure didn't make it clear that the user's specific request should take precedence over general improvements.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Structure
- **[PRIMARY INSTRUCTION]**: Explicitly states that the user's request is the main focus
- **[USER'S SPECIFIC REQUEST]**: Clearly separates and highlights the user's context
- **[CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS]**: Reinforces that the user's request must be the primary focus

### 2. Improved Context Emphasis
- Made the user's context more prominent in the prompt
- Added explicit instructions that the context is the PRIMARY focus
- Included critical instructions that reinforce the importance of the user's request

### 3. Better Frontend Guidance
- Updated the UI with clearer examples of effective context requests
- Added text emphasizing that the specific request will be the primary focus
- Provided examples that match common user needs

## Key Changes Made

### Backend (backend_api.py)
1. Added **[PRIMARY INSTRUCTION]** section to emphasize user context
2. Renamed **[USER REQUEST]** to **[USER'S SPECIFIC REQUEST]** for clarity
3. Added **[CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS]** section with explicit emphasis on the user's request
4. Restructured the prompt to make the user's context more prominent

### Frontend (EnhancedDocTweaker.tsx)
1. Updated placeholder text with clearer examples
2. Added descriptive text emphasizing that the specific request is the primary focus
3. Provided examples that match common user needs like "Add a conclusion at the end"

## Expected Benefits

1. **Better Context Utilization**: User's specific requests will be properly prioritized
2. **More Relevant Results**: Enhancements will focus on what the user actually wants
3. **Clearer Expectations**: Users will understand how to write effective requests
4. **Improved User Satisfaction**: Results will better match user expectations

## Testing Verification

Created and ran tests that confirm:
- Context is properly emphasized in the prompt
- All key sections are present and correctly structured
- User's specific request is clearly highlighted

## Example of Improved Prompt Structure

```
[ROLE]
You are an expert document enhancer...

[PRIMARY INSTRUCTION]
The user has provided a specific request. This MUST be the primary focus...

[FORMAT PRESERVATION RULES]
...

[USER'S SPECIFIC REQUEST]
add conclusion at the end

[DOCUMENT TO ENHANCE]
Name : yash dave I am a passionate software developer...

[CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS]
1. The USER'S SPECIFIC REQUEST above is the PRIMARY focus - make this happen
2. Preserve ALL formatting exactly as shown
3. Return ONLY the enhanced document
4. Do not include any additional commentary or explanations
```

This structure ensures that Gemini understands "add conclusion at the end" is the primary task that must be accomplished.

## Best Practices for Users

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "improve this", use "add a conclusion"
2. **Single Focus**: One clear request works better than multiple requests
3. **Actionable Language**: Use verbs like "add", "remove", "reorganize"
4. **Clear Objectives**: State exactly what you want to achieve

These improvements should ensure that user context is properly utilized and that the AI focuses on exactly what the user wants to accomplish.
