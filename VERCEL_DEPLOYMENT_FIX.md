# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue
Vercel was trying to deploy Python backend functions that are no longer needed since the backend has been moved to Render.

Error message:
```
Error: Function Runtimes must have a valid version, for example `now-php@1.0.0`.
```

## Solution
Updated `vercel.json` to remove Python function configurations and only deploy the frontend.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated vercel.json
- Removed the `functions` section that was trying to deploy Python backend functions
- Removed the API routes that were pointing to Python functions
- Kept only the basic frontend deployment configuration

### 2. Before (Problematic Configuration)
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "functions": {
    "api/health.py": {
      "runtime": "vercel-python@3.9"
    },
    "api/enhance.py": {
      "runtime": "vercel-python@3.9"
    }
  },
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/health",
      "dest": "/api/health.py"
    },
    {
      "src": "/api/enhance",
      "dest": "/api/enhance.py"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. After (Fixed Configuration)
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Verification
- Frontend correctly communicates with Render backend at https://doctweaker.onrender.com
- EnhancedDocTweaker component uses enhancedBackendService which reads VITE_API_URL from environment variables
- No more Python function deployment errors

## Next Steps
The next deployment to Vercel should succeed without the function runtime errors.
