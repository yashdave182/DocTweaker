# CORS Issue Resolution Summary

## Problem Identified
The frontend was getting CORS errors when trying to access the backend API because:
1. There were conflicting Vercel serverless functions in the `api/` directory
2. The frontend was trying to call `/enhance` instead of `/api/enhance`
3. The Vercel serverless functions were not properly configured for CORS

## Root Cause
The application had both:
- Render backend at https://doctweaker.onrender.com with proper `/api/*` endpoints
- Vercel serverless functions in `api/` directory that were conflicting

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Conflicting Vercel Serverless Functions
- Deleted `api/enhance.py`
- Deleted `api/health.py`
- Deleted `api/requirements.txt`
- Removed the `api/` directory entirely

### 2. Fixed Frontend API Configuration
Updated `src/lib/enhancedBackendService.ts` to ensure it always uses the VITE_API_URL:
- Changed from: `import.meta.env.PROD ? "/api" : "http://localhost:3001"`
- Changed to: `import.meta.env.DEV ? "http://localhost:3001" : import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`

This ensures that in production, it always uses the Render backend URL.

### 3. Verified Backend Endpoints
Confirmed that the Render backend has the correct endpoints:
- `GET /api/health` ✅
- `POST /api/upload` ✅
- `POST /api/enhance` ✅
- `POST /api/process` ✅
- `GET /api/download/<id>` ✅

## Verification
- All API endpoints are working correctly on Render
- Frontend will now correctly communicate with Render backend
- CORS is properly configured in the Render backend
- No more conflicts between Vercel serverless functions and Render backend

## Next Steps
Deploy the updated code to Vercel. The CORS errors should now be resolved.
