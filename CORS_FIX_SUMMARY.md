# CORS Issue Resolution Summary

## Problem Identified
The frontend was making API calls to `https://doctweaker.onrender.com/enhance` instead of `https://doctweaker.onrender.com/api/enhance`, causing CORS preflight errors.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Enhanced Backend Service
Modified `src/lib/enhancedBackendService.ts` to ensure all API endpoints use the correct `/api/` prefix:
- Health check: `${API_BASE_URL}/api/health`
- Upload: `${API_BASE_URL}/api/upload`
- Enhance: `${API_BASE_URL}/api/enhance`
- Process: `${API_BASE_URL}/api/process`
- Download: `${API_BASE_URL}/api/download/${documentId}`

### 2. Cleaned Environment Variables
Removed duplicate entry in `.env` file for `VITE_API_URL`

### 3. Verified Component Usage
Confirmed that the main document processing component (`EnhancedDocTweaker.tsx`) correctly uses the enhanced backend service.

## Remaining Steps

### 1. Rebuild and Redeploy Frontend
The Vercel deployment needs to be updated with the latest code:
```bash
# Clean build
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel (or trigger deployment through Vercel dashboard)
```

### 2. Clear Browser Cache
Users should clear their browser cache or perform a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to ensure they're loading the latest frontend code.

### 3. Verify Backend CORS Configuration
The backend CORS configuration has been updated to:
```python
frontend_url = os.getenv("FRONTEND_URL", "*")
CORS(app, origins=[frontend_url])
```

With the environment variable set to `https://doctweaker.vercel.app` in Render.

## Testing
After deployment, test the following endpoints:
1. https://doctweaker.onrender.com/api/health (should return 200 OK)
2. Document enhancement workflow through the frontend

## Expected Result
The CORS preflight error should be resolved as the frontend will now correctly call:
`https://doctweaker.onrender.com/api/enhance`

Instead of:
`https://doctweaker.onrender.com/enhance`
