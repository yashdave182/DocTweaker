# Improving Gemini Response Quality

## Current Issues
Even with gemini-2.5-pro (or gemini-1.5-pro), the responses might not be as good as expected. Here are several factors that could be affecting quality:

## 1. Model Name Issues
The model name "gemini-2.5-pro" might not be valid. Using "gemini-1.5-pro-latest" is more reliable.

## 2. Prompt Engineering Improvements
The current prompt can be enhanced in several ways:

### a. Better Structure
- Use clear section delimiters
- Separate instructions from content more distinctly
- Add examples of expected behavior

### b. More Specific Instructions
- Provide concrete examples of what "improving clarity" means
- Define what "professional tone" looks like
- Give specific guidance on handling different content types

### c. Reduced Conflicting Instructions
- The current prompt has many rules that might conflict
- Simplify to the most essential format preservation rules

## 3. Generation Parameters
- Temperature: 0.3 is good for consistency, but might reduce creativity
- Consider adjusting based on the type of enhancement requested
- Max output tokens might be limiting for longer documents

## 4. Context Utilization
- The context provided by users might be too vague
- Need better guidance on how to write effective enhancement requests

## Suggested Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Structure
```
[ROLE DEFINITION]
You are an expert document enhancer specializing in improving content while preserving exact formatting.

[FORMAT PRESERVATION RULES]
1. NEVER modify formatting markers: **bold**, *italic*, <<<PAGE_BREAK>>>, [1], [2], etc.
2. NEVER change document structure: headings, paragraphs, lists, tables
3. NEVER reorganize content order
4. NEVER add or remove lines

[ENHANCEMENT FOCUS]
- Fix grammar and spelling
- Improve word choice and clarity
- Adjust tone based on user request
- Make content more professional or engaging as requested

[USER REQUEST]
{context}

[DOCUMENT]
{text}

[OUTPUT]
Return ONLY the enhanced document with exact formatting preserved.
```

### 2. Adaptive Generation Parameters
Different types of enhancements might benefit from different parameters:
- Grammar fixes: Lower temperature (0.2-0.3)
- Creative enhancements: Higher temperature (0.5-0.7)
- Tone adjustments: Medium temperature (0.4-0.5)

### 3. Better User Guidance
Provide examples in the UI:
- "Fix grammar and spelling errors"
- "Make this sound more professional for a business proposal"
- "Improve clarity for technical documentation"
- "Make this more engaging for a general audience"

## Implementation Plan

1. Update model name to a known working version
2. Simplify and improve the prompt structure
3. Add adaptive generation parameters based on context
4. Improve user guidance in the frontend
5. Add logging to see what prompts are being sent
6. Test with various document types and contexts

## Testing Approach

1. Create test documents with various formatting
2. Try different enhancement contexts
3. Compare results with different prompt versions
4. Measure quality and preservation accuracy
5. Optimize based on results

These improvements should help get better quality responses from Gemini while maintaining format preservation.
